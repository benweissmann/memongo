Contributing guidelines
=======================

### Git workflow

* We use git-flow - create a feature branch from `develop`, e.g. `feature/new-feature`
* Pull requests must contain a succinct, clear summary of what the user need is driving this feature change
* Ensure your branch contains logical atomic commits before sending a pull request - follow the [alphagov Git styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
* You may rebase your branch after feedback if it's to include relevant updates from the develop branch. We prefer a rebase here to a merge commit as we prefer a clean and straight history on develop with discrete merge commits for features
